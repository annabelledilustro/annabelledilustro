#### Aerodynamic investigation of vowel nasalization in Japanese

Anticipatory vowel nasalization is a process whereby vowels preceding nasal consonants become nasalized. Aerodynamic studies on English vowel nasalization have found that vowel nasalization is not conditioned by syllable structure (Cohn, 1990). In Spanish, however, syllable structure plays a significant role in influencing the extent of nasalization in vowels (Beristain, 2024). Japanese is an interesting case because converging sources of evidence indicate the significance of moraic structure including tautosyllabic moraic coda nasals. This raises the question of whether the moraic boundary has the same effects on anticipatory nasalization as a syllabic one. For this study, we designed an experiment that aims to test the hypothesis that the moraic organization of coda nasals in Japanese leads to less substantial anticipatory nasalization within syllables. Preliminary results show that anticipatory vowel nasalization in Japanese is not influenced by the presence of a syllabic boundary between the relevant nasal consonant and the preceding vowel.Â With this study, we aim to provide much needed acoustic and aerodynamic analysis of nasalization in Japanese, adding to our typological understanding of nasalization crosslinguistically. The study is being extended to L2 populations of varying degrees of proficiency in Japanese to investigate the learnability of this pattern. The language-specific nature of vowel nasalization suggests that L2 speakers will need to master the observed pattern of Japanese if it differs from their L1. This study is part of my ongoing research for my qualifying paper.
