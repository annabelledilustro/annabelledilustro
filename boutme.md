### Vampiric Linguistics 

I'm an avid horror fan (book, film, and game recommendations are always welcome). Last year, I designed and taught my own writing course on sociolinguistics and vampire and zombie media (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fws.arts.cornell.edu/brochures/2024FA_Brochure.pdf">LING1100 Speech and the Undead</a>). We read and discussed papers like this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0075424216669747">Reichelt & Durham (2016)</a> paper.
